# Assorted-Projects
Repository with assorted small projects at various stages.

## Current contents:

* `Poisson-Bootstrap`: First attempt at implementing a poisson bootstrap to get uncertainty in mean and variance estimates when working with large data sets. Currently working but considerably slower than I'd like.
* `GP-presentation`: Presentation on Gaussian Process models done for Data Science Friday at the Recurse Center.
* `SlideRule-DS-Intensive`: Some exercises from SlideRule/SpringBoard's data science curriculum done to gain more familiarity with Python data tools.
* `Vowel Overlap`: Implementing a method for measuring overlap between vowel categories in R and Stan. Roughly based on Morrison, 2005 but with some modifications.
* `csvdb`: Project to get used to IO stuff in Rust. In very early stages, but the eventual goal is a tool for converting between csv and database files.
