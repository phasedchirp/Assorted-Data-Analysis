# SlideRule-DS-Intensive

This is a set of projects I've been using in an effort to get more fluent with Python Data Analysis tools.

This started with working through the SlideRule Data Science curriculum but also includes additional items.

## Contents:

* UD120 - Projects from the Udacity Machine Learning course
* Inferential Statistics - Ipython Notebooks for SlideRule inferential statistics assignments.
* Data Wrangling - IPython Notebooks for SlideRule data wrangling assignments
