# Motivation

# Parametric models

## Linear Models

## Sometimes they work

## Sometimes they don't

## Basis expansion

## Polynomial bases

## Periodic bases

## Smooth functions

## Weirder things

## Radial basis functions

# Non-parametric models (sort of)

## The Kernel Trick

## Function spaces

# Gaussian Processes

## What are they?

## Distributions over functions

## Generalizing the multivariate gaussian distribution

# Practical stuff

## Working definition

## Mean functions

## Covariance functions

## Kernels and kernel parameters

## Inference

# Real-world examples

## Use-cases

## Running example 1

## Running example 2

## Running example N

# Other cool stuff

## Further reading

## Generalizations
